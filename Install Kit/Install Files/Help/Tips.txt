You can decide whether or not to have a tool-bar and which buttons it should contain. Select <CODE>Tools - Options</CODE> from the menu and look at the General Options and Main Toolbar items.
You can re-call this screen at any time if you want to see a quick summary of the numbers of items in the database. Select <CODE>Help-Summary Info</CODE> from the main menu.
Use the <CODE>Tools-Options-Appearances</CODE> facilities to choose <FONT Color="Red">c</FONT><FONT Color="Blue">o</FONT><FONT Color="Yellow">l</FONT><FONT Color="Green">o</FONT><FONT Color="Purple">u</FONT><FONT Color="Lime">r</FONT><FONT Color="Teal">s</FONT> used by the application.

You can give other people Rucksacks and Recording cards you have set up. Rucksacks are stored in files with a "ruk" extension and Recording cards have a "crd" extension. Look in <CODE>Tools-Options-File locations</CODE> to find out which directory they are stored in by default. They are ordinary text files, so just copy them to and from a floppy disk or attach them to an email.
Use <CODE>Help - About</CODE> to find out which version of the application you have, what add-ins are installed and other technical details. This can be very useful if you have a problem and need to contact technical support.
Did you know that clicking on the heading of a list (for example, the "Scientific name" and "Common name" headers in the taxonomic dictionary window) will sort the list. Clicking once sorts it in ascending order, clicking again reverses the order.
You can copy information from the details which are shown when a species or habitat is selected in the dictionary browsers. Highlight some text by dragging the mouse over it and copy it to the Windows clipboard using <CODE>Edit-Copy</CODE> from the main menu or by pressing <KBRD>Ctrl-C</KBRD>. It can then be pasted into almost any Windows application - such as a document in your word-processor.
If you have a Rucksack open, then double-clicking a species name in the taxonomic dictionary, or a habitat category in the biotope dictionary, will add it to the appropriate list in the Rucksack.
You can use accented characters (e.g. "Fall&eacute;n", "M&uuml;ller") in comments, descriptions, etc. One way of inserting them is to use the the Windows character map (<CODE>Start - Programs - Accessories - Character Map</CODE> from the Windows menus). Another way is to hold down the Alt key and then type the 3-digit ASCII character number <B>on the numeric keypad</B>. For example, Alt-130 produces "&eacute;". Look for a list of ASCII characters in the back of the manuals that came with your computer or operating system.
This application uses HTML 3.2 for a variety of purposes (including these tips!) and XML 1.0 for data transfer. You can get the specifications for these, and many other standards relating to the internet, from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) website at www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TR/. 
When you pick a coordinate or grid reference from the map, Recorder 6 will now show you a temporary marker so you can be sure the reference is in the right place.
In the report output screen, you can re-order the table columns by dragging and dropping them.
